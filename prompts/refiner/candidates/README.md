# Candidate Prompts Directory

This directory holds auto-generated prompt proposals from:
1. AI-assisted prompt authoring (scripts/propose_prompt_update.py)
2. Feedback-driven refinements

## Naming Convention
Candidate files follow the pattern:
- `<date>-<hash>.md` (e.g., `2025-01-23-a1b2c3.md`)

## Workflow
1. Candidate prompt is generated and saved here
2. CI runs evaluation against gold datasets (evals/)
3. If metrics pass thresholds:
   - PR is opened
   - Human reviews and merges
   - active.yaml is updated
4. Old candidates are archived after 30 days

## Do NOT manually create files here
All files should be generated by automated processes.
